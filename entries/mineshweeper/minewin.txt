HI all, This is my first "big" appearance...
This is my game for GBDEV 2000... I don't have much time, but I will say a few things.

Tools I used:  
ASMotor (rgbasm,xlink,rgbfix)
GBTD and GBMB
and a text editor.


Anyhow... 

I do have a website, and I may be posting the code for this game shortly...
My website is http://gbdev.8k.com 
My email address is sgstair@fcmail.com

I hope there are a lot of good entries!

Stephen
