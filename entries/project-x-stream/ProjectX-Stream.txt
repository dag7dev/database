!only 32k!

NEW VERSION - Changes - 
speed up collectable - 
full 3 levels - 
level 2 boss fixed-
powerups fixed.

-How to play-
Use the B button to shoot (just keep it pressed). Blast everything you
see. Try to get through all 3 levels and kill the boss at the end of
each level.

Collect the (S)peed-ups for a faster ship.
Collect the (p)ower-ups for better weapons.

-Here are the powerups:

Weapon one - The standard shooter.
Weapon two - A double shooter that has a wider range.
Weapon Three - The crest wave which can't be stopped by baddies.
Weapon four - Double Crest Wave.
Weapon five - Shield (Can be re-charged with every extra power-up).

-Advice (you can never get enough):

KEEP FIRE PRESSED! - It gives the best fire power!
Keep moving
Don't fire when you don't have to (eg. in the asteroid storm)
The first boss is VERY easy when you work out how the fireballs attack.
In the Tunnels its best to keep getting the shield over and over.
The boss on level 2 can only be destroyed by a powerful ship :)

Why is the game so hard?
Well it makes it more of a challenge, and there are only 3 levels.
Besides, I think the harder the game the more lastablilty it has,
R-Type is very hard, but is a great challenge.

This game was written over a couple of months on and off, usually at
night. It was written using GBDK and RGB-assembler (with the GB 
assembler studio).

I'm quite pleased with it on no$gb (which I used to test it) but I have
not seen it on a real Colour GB (So there may be flicker problems).

I don't really understand sound so I could only get a few clicks out
of it :) Maybe I'll work on that if someone can help.

The graphics are by me and I used the neat gameboy tile designer.
I'm not very good at graphics, and Helen who usually does them was busy
over the last few months. I think I did well anyway :þ

It works on the normal GB but its not designed for it. There may be
graphics glitches. Use a Colour GB.

There was parallax scrolling until the last minute when I removed it as
it sometimes corrupted the display (more often than not :) I'm going
to work on the idea for my next game - It can be done in 100% aSm.

The game should not be confused with the film ProjectX, or any of the
old games called ProjectX (3!), it has nothing to do with them. Its 
called 'Project-X-Stream'.

The small font was converted by Quang.

The game is quite hard, but you can complete it once you get used to 
the levels (practice makes perfect - Or savegame makes perfect ;).

I'd like to work on a commercial gameboy game if anyone wants to hire 
me! I can code in z80 and know the gameboy hardware very well.
I'm based in England (Newcastle).
