    "description": "The first version of POKE Mission was written in 1990-1991 by Anders and Leif Granlund. It was written in STOS-Basic for the Atari ST. A couple of weeks ago I discovered the Dr.Pan of Anthrox document, and became more and more interested in programming on the Gameboy. I have never used assembler before, but thanks to the excellent document I soon learned how to use sprites, background, etc\u2026 There has been two official demo-versions (ver0.1 and ver 0.2) released before this FINAL version was completed!",
